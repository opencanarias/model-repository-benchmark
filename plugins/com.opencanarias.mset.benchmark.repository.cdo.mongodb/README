There are some limitations identified in MongoDBStore:

- Since resources are committed into a single document, MongoDBStore does not allow big models.
  MongoDB sets the document limitation to 16Mb. For anything bigger than that, the documentation recommends GirdFS.
  Thats the reason 2 benchmark cases are skipped
  
- There is a bug on server restart: the implementation is unable to find the root resource. Therefore, any
  benchmark case requiring restart would fail. Thats the reason for yet another benchmark case being skipped.
